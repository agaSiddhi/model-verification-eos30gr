Run and reproduce model eos30gr

## Repository organisation
The repository is organised in folders:
- '/notebooks' contains the jupyter notebooks where most of the work is being developed
- '/data' contains all the .csv files. Model predictions are obtained outside this repository and saved in this folder. Subfolders might be created if needed
- '/src' contains important functions I will re-use throughout the repository, to avoid typing them each time
- '/figures' contains the plots I have produced during the model validation process
- 'requirements.txt' lists all the required packages to run the notebooks in this repository. If possible I also specify the version of the package I am using.

## License
All the code in this repository is licensed under a GPLv3 License.
